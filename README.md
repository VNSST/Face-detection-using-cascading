# Face-detection-using-cascading
In this project, the model will be able to detect all the human faces infront of the camera and timestamps in the videostream are recorded in a text file for future security references. This is done with the help of Cascade classifier which detects and tracks human faces with good speed.
#### Language used : Python
#### Ide : Jupyter Notebook

#### Algorithms / Modules used:
1. OpenCV
2. logging
3. Cascade classifier

#### Steps:
1. Open Jupyter notebook
2. Download the zip file from this repository and unzip 
3. Open the folder you downloaded and copy the path 
4. Track the same path using your jupyter notebook
5. Install opencv on your computer
6. Now using jupyter notebook open the .ipynb file
7. Create an empty text file of the name of your choice
8. In the .ipynb file replace the text file path and name
9. Run each cell one after other
10. Now you can check the outputs in the imshow popup and also in the text file you created.
